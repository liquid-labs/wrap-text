// mean we should avoid. Besides, with the use of modules, there's an easy solution: create a function that's not
// exported outside the class.
// NOTE: We tried 'throw expressions', but the resulting code did not seem logically consistent with the source code.
// This certainly could have been user error, but simpler to just avoid it for now.
